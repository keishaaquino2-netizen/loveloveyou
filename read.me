Hello ❤️,

I like you"

**I love you.**  
To be honest, I don’t really know how to express what I truly feel
You’re my sunshine  when I’m with you, everything else fades away
When we talk, everything feels okay
I don’t want to sound corny when I’m in love, but this is my first time doing something like this, hehe.
Please take care of yourself.
I really, really like you, my bebi. 💜
